.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBconcat-fuse\fR is a FUSE based filesystem that
allows accessing groups of files as if they were a single large
file. In most cases direct interaction with
\fBconcat-fuse\fR isn't needed, as the convinience
tool \fBcfconcat\fR hides the plumbing away.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBconcat-fuse\fR doesn't provide options on it's
own, but will accept the general mount options provided by \fBfuse\fR(8)
.SH STRUCTURE
The filesystem, once mounted, provides three subdirectories
named \*(T<\fIfrom\-file0/\fR\*(T>,
\*(T<\fIfrom\-glob0/\fR\*(T> and
\*(T<\fIfrom\-zip/\fR\*(T>. Writing a '\e0' separated list of
files or glob pattern to the \*(T<\fIcontrol\fR\*(T> file
within those directories will create a virtual file containing
all the content of the individual files. The
\*(T<\fIfrom\-zip/control\fR\*(T> only takes only a single
filename, without a '\e0'. The name of the virtual file is the
SHA1 checksum of the data written to the control file.
